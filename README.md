# Snake JS

This is the classic Snake game, is my first attempt at writing code and served as an introduction to learning and understanding a programming language. Any code written here does not adhere to any coding standards and is likely there will be a mountain of mistakes made!

### Controls

- Use `w` to move the snake up
- Use `s` to move the snake down
- Use `a` to move the snake left
- Use `d` to move the snake right

_The snake cannot invert its direction if for example it is travelling up (`w`) then down with `s`_
